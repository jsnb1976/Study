# CSMVessel0000000005 Entertainment V2.0
## Project Noah's Aegis: Maritime Entertainment Systems Resilience Under High-Flux EM Events
### Version 2.0 | June 2026

## Changes V1.0 to V2.0
- GaN solid-state audio amplifiers: 97% efficiency (same tech as Safe-Wave CSMFAB005) applied
- LED theatrical lighting: all-ceramic driver ICs in BFRP housings (GIC-immune)
- OLED display panels: flexible BFRP-backed OLED for structural compliance
- MXene-shielded AV server rooms: SE=92 dB (replaces V1.0 copper enclosure SE=45 dB)
- Acoustic design: Silence-Block (CSMFAB032) LRAM technology scales to theater scale
- Solar Cycle 25: entertainment systems = non-safety IT -> lowest priority in failure hierarchy

## 1. Entertainment System Vulnerability V2.0

Cruise ship entertainment systems typically include:
- Main theater: 1,200+ seats, full stage rigging, lighting, audio ($8-15M value)
- Casino: ~500 slot machines, 40+ gaming tables (electronic + conductive)
- Multiple restaurants: AV systems, automated beverage systems
- Lido deck: outdoor LED screens, weather-proofed audio
- Fiber network: ship-wide WiFi, IPTV

**V2.0 GIC risk assessment per system:**

| System | GIC Risk | Failure Mode | Priority |
|---|---|---|---|
| Casino slot machines | CRITICAL | PCB burnout at 43 V/km | Revenue critical |
| Main theater lighting (LED drivers) | HIGH | Driver IC destruction | Operations |
| Main theater audio (copper amps) | HIGH | Output stage burnout | Operations |
| IPTV/WiFi infrastructure | HIGH | Switch/router burnout | Passenger exp. |
| Navigation PA / emergency broadcast | CRITICAL | Must survive -> Aegis priority | Safety |

## 2. V2.0 Aegis Entertainment Systems

### 2.1 GaN Audio Amplifiers (per CSMFAB000000000005 Science)

Same GaN HEMT technology as Safe-Wave microwave source:
- Drain efficiency: 97% (vs Class AB 65%)
- V2.0: all audio amplifiers specified as GaN Class-D or Class-F topology
- GaN chip packaging: MXene-shielded ceramic package (SE=92 dB for GHz susceptibility)
- Signal input: PMMA optical fiber from DSP (zero metal signal path)

**Ship-wide audio system GIC immunity:**
- All copper signal cables replaced with PMMA POF (per CSMFAB000000000013 design)
- Power amplifiers: GaN in BFRP-cased, MXene-shielded enclosures
- Loudspeaker wiring: retained copper (OK for power wiring with DC-blocking capacitors)
- Result: zero GIC signal corruption; amplifiers survive indefinitely in storm field

### 2.2 LRAM Theater Acoustic Insulation

MIT 2025 LRAM technology (per CSMFAB000000000032 Silence-Block):
Scaled from automotive (4-door panels) to theater scale (60m2 stage wall):
- WC sphere resonators (d=8.5mm) in magnetite-doped PDMS matrix
- Panel: 15mm thick, -65 dB at 250 Hz
- Theater separation: adjacent theater sound bleed at 250 Hz reduced 99.97%
- Ship vibration: main-theater-to-seating vibration at 25 Hz: -31 dB reduction

### 2.3 Casino Slot Machine GIC Protection

Each slot machine = a sealed inductive loop (power cord + internal PCB copper)
At 43 V/km across casino floor (30m): V_induced ~1.3 V; I in low-R PCB traces = significant currents.

V2.0 solution per machine:
- BFRP outer case (replaces ABS plastic + steel frame): $180/machine conversion
- MXene inner shield: $45/machine
- Optical fiber payment terminal: $220/machine
Total per machine: $445; 500 machines: $222,500/ship
vs. one storm event destroying all machines: $5M+ replacement cost.
